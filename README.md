# Alpha-Numeric-character-recognition-using-TensorFlow
Using EMNIST dataset for 'byclass' category to obtain a network which can classify any alpha (capital and small) numeric character with high precision. After fitting the model, a testset accuracy of 0.8133 is obtained. This is a bit low because of the striking similarities between some characters ('x' and 'X', 0 and 'O' and 'o'). The notebook also compares the predictions obtained and the actual images using plots.
